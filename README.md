## Main Classes
### **Main Classes and Their Purpose**
- `MyApp` - The root of the application. It sets up theming, routing, and manages the app state using Bloc.
- `AuthBloc` - Handles authentication state and events, such as signing in, signing out, and checking user status.
- `Router` - Defines navigation rules using `go_router`.
- `Splash`, `Main`, and `Auth` screens - Core UI screens for user navigation and interaction.
- `InjectionContainer` - Manages dependency injection to facilitate decoupling and testing.
